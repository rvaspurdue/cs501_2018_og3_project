# Code overview

# Code is a slightly modified version of the above

bagclassifier.py - The Keras model
train.py - For pre-processing images and training the model
classify.py - References the model to make predictions for an image

# Install conda for your OS

https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html

# Set up the environment
I included a spec file called spec-file.txt what can be used to create the
exact environment I used to build and run the classifier

https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments

conda create --name cs501 --file spec-file.txt

Then you need to use pip to install the 'imutils' package

pip install imutils

# Run the classifier

python3 classify.py -m bagclassifier.model -l labels.bin -i erik_carryon_front.jpg
